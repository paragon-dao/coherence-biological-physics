**Coherence-Mediated Human Coupling Hypothesis (CMH): A Framework for Planetary-Scale Biological Resonance**

## Overview

This repository contains the complete framework for the Coherence-Mediated Human Coupling Hypothesis (CMH), a scientific hypothesis proposing that human physiological systems participate in coherence-based coupling mediated by the Earth–Moon system.
