# Abstract

Human physiological systems—particularly the heart, its structural surroundings, and its rhythmic wave-like emissions—may partake in a coherence-based coupling process mediated by the Earth–Moon system. This process could produce entanglement-like correlations between individuals, reliant on extremely narrow thermal precision. The theory is speculative but generates testable predictions and invites multidisciplinary examination.
