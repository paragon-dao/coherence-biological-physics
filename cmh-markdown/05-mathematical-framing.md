# 4. Mathematical Framing

The Coherence-Mediated Human Coupling Hypothesis (CMH) requires a mathematical framework capable of describing:

- Human-generated coherence
- Planetary resonance mediation
- Inter-human coupling through shared oscillatory fields
- Dependence on strict thermal precision

The following is an initial structural model intended to guide future formalization and empirical testing.

## 4.1 Human as a Coherent Oscillator

We represent each human system as an oscillator characterized by:

- $f_h$ — dominant physiological oscillation frequency (heart–brain complex)
- $L_h$ — coherence length (extent of stable oscillatory influence)
- $\Delta T_h$ — allowable thermal deviation for coherent stability
- $A_h$ — amplitude of the coherence field generated

Thus, each human coherence field can be modeled as:

$$H(t) = A_h \cdot e^{i(2\pi f_h t + \phi_h)} \cdot \Phi(\Delta T_h)$$

Where:

- $\phi_h$ is phase
- $\Phi(\Delta T_h)$ is a thermal stability function

We define:

$$\Phi(\Delta T_h) = e^{-\alpha |\Delta T|}$$

Where $\alpha$ is the thermal sensitivity constant.

This reflects that coherence decays as temperature deviates from the human norm, consistent with biology and quantum-like behavior.

## 4.2 Earth–Moon System as a Resonant Medium

Let the Earth–Moon system be represented as a planetary resonator with:

- $f_{em}$ — fundamental frequency of the Earth–Moon system
- $H_{em}(n)$ — harmonic spectrum
- $C_{em}$ — coupling coefficient describing how effectively the Earth–Moon resonance transmits or amplifies biological oscillations
- $Q_{em}$ — quality factor of the planetary resonator

The resonance field can be expressed as:

$$R_{em}(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} H_{em}(n) \cdot e^{i(2\pi n f_{em} t)}$$

The coupling between a human oscillator and the Earth–Moon resonance is:

$$\Gamma = C_{em} \cdot \int H(t) \cdot R_{em}(t) \, dt$$

This term, $\Gamma$, measures how strongly an individual's coherence interacts with the planetary resonance structure.

## 4.3 Inter-Human Coupling Through Shared Resonance

We propose that two human oscillators can couple through the Earth–Moon medium via:

$$S_{12} = \Gamma_1 \Gamma_2 \cdot e^{i(\phi_1 - \phi_2)} \cdot \Psi(d)$$

Where:

- $S_{12}$ = coupling strength between two individuals
- $\Psi(d)$ = distance influence function
- For true quantum entanglement, $\Psi(d) = 1$ (distance-independent)
- For coherence-mediated coupling, $\Psi(d)$ may be weakly distance-dependent or distance-independent over planetary scales

Thus, CMH predicts:

**Inter-human correlations arise from shared coherence through resonance, not classical signal transfer.**

This allows correlations across large distances without violating known physics.

## 4.4 Sleep-State and Consciousness-Dependent Modulation

Let $\sigma(t)$ represent consciousness state (wake, REM sleep, deep sleep, meditation).

We define modulation:

$$A_h(t) = A_0 \cdot M(\sigma(t))$$

Where $M(\sigma)$ enhances coherence during:

- deep sleep
- REM phases
- meditation
- flow states

This encodes the observation that sleep is a primary window for coupling, enabling possible entanglement-like interactions.

## 4.5 Entire System Summary Equation

We can express the entire CMH structure as:

$$S_{coupled} = \left( A_1 A_2 \cdot \Phi(\Delta T_1)\Phi(\Delta T_2) \right) \cdot C_{em}^2 \cdot \left| \int H_1(t) R_{em}(t) dt \right| \left| \int H_2(t) R_{em}(t) dt \right| \cdot \Psi(d) \cdot M(\sigma_1)M(\sigma_2)$$

This combined equation embodies the core idea:

**Human coherence → Planetary resonance → Inter-human coupling**

And incorporates:

- frequency
- amplitude
- thermal precision
- planetary mediation
- consciousness states
- distance dependence

This is testable, falsifiable, and expandable into any mathematical sophistication needed by future collaborators.
